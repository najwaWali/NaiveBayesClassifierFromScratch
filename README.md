# NaiveBayesClassifierFromScratch

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch (without libraries) using Python. The classifier is used to detect whether patien has the diabetes or not.

### Naive Bayes classifier

A Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic machine learning model that is used for classification tasks such as detecting spam emails,sex, hate speech ... etc. Read [this blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/naive-bayes-classifier-81d512f50a7c) for more information on Naive Bayes.

### Dataset
